# Tailwind CSS Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS classes. The problem involves unexpected behavior with flexbox and text overflow, potentially stemming from conflicts with other styles or improper class usage. The solution explores strategies to mitigate these issues, ensuring proper alignment and text rendering.

## Bug Description

The bug relates to unexpected behavior when attempting to align items using Tailwind's flexbox utilities.  Under certain conditions, the expected alignment may not occur.  In addition, text within a container might overflow its boundaries, even when appropriate padding and overflow controls are applied. These issues can stem from various sources, including class order, conflicting CSS rules, or subtle errors in class selection.

## Solution

The solution involves a careful review of the CSS rules and potentially adjusting the Tailwind configuration or application of CSS overrides.  This may involve clarifying the order of Tailwind classes to ensure precedence and adding missing constraints to manage text overflow.
